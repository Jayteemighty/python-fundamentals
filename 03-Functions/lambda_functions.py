# A lambda function is a short, anonymous function that can have any number of arguments but only one expression.

# lambda arguments: expression

# Example:
square = lambda x: x**2
print(square(5)) # Output: 25


# Lambda functions are often used with built-in functions like map(), filter(), and reduce().
